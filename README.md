# Lab Guide

A VS Code extension that turns slide decks into interactive, guided hands-on labs.

## Features

- **Slide-coupled guidance** - updates automatically when you advance slides
- **Directional focus** - glowing edges and arrows point you to slides, chat, terminal, or editor
- **Auto-actions** - opens Copilot Chat, terminal, settings, or files for you
- **Sub-steps** - multi-step slides with Previous/Next navigation
- **Course catalog** - browse and launch courses from a built-in view
- **Profile isolation** - runs in a dedicated profile so your settings are untouched

## Getting Started

The extension launches automatically and opens the course catalog. Pick a course and go. No configuration needed.

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.85+ (or VS Code Insiders)
- GitHub Copilot extension
- Internet connection

## Privacy

When you start a lab, this extension reads your GitHub username from your existing Copilot session to track training progress. No additional sign-in is required. The only other network requests are to GitHub Pages to load course content.

A GitHub Copilot license is not required to view course slides in VS Code. It is required to use the interactive lab companion.
